ANNdotNET is an open-source project written in C# that aims to simplify deep learning/machine learning tasks: 
- data preparation
- model creation, 
- visualy designing deep network, 
- training process, 
- model validation and testing, and
- deployment. 

Unlike version v1 that is based on Microsoft CNTK, the AnndotNET v2 implements 
ML Engine based on TorchSharp, allowing users to perform deep learning operations 
with the cutting - edge DL framework. 

The project is still in development phase.
