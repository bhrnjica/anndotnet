ANNdotNET is an open-source project written in C# that aims to simplify deep learning/machine learning tasks: 
- data preparation
- model creation, 
- visualy designing deep network, 
- training process, 
- model validation and testing, and
- deployment. 

For all above tasks AnndotNet provides a GUI tool that you can create very complex deep learning model in just a few clicks.
The whole model can be save in MLConfig json file.  

Unlike version v1 that is based on Microsoft CNTK, the AnndotNET v2 implements 
ML Engine based on Tensorflow, allowing users to perform deep learning operations 
with the cutting - edge DL framework.
